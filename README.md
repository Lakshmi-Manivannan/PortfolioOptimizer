Investment in stocks provides highest potential returns and over a long term no other type
of investments tends to perform better. But at the same time, Stocks are more volatile
investments which means the value of stocks can drop in short term. So to provide
investment guidance to investors we use modern portfolio theory in which investors can to
choose their portfolio to minimize risk while simultaneously obtaining the maximum amount
of return. Portfolios are collection of securities, such as stocks and bonds, which are held by
an investor. One way to describe a portfolio is by listing the proportion of the total value of
the portfolio that is invested into each security. These proportions are called portfolio
weights. Since the future is uncertain, so this must mean that we value a stock by its
expected present value; and similarly must value a portfolio of securities. Thinking of the
present values of securities as random variables, it seemed obvious that one should seek
high expected value and low variance on the portfolio as a whole. There are many other
ways to optimize portfolio but they are quite expensive and require huge computing power
even for a simple optimization. In this project, we are designing and developing a GUI based
application model for investment guidance to users based on portfolio optimization model.
